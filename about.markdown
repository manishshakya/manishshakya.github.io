Hi, I’m Manish Shakya — an embedded systems engineer, lifelong tinkerer, and curious mind with a deep love for building things. I have over 18 years of hands-on experience designing and engineering embedded solutions — from firmware to full-blown embedded Linux systems used in test vehicles around the world.

I’m currently a Senior Embedded Linux Engineer at Intrepid Control Systems, where I’ve spent more than a decade helping develop wireless data logging devices used by major vehicle OEMs. My role covers a wide range of responsibilities, including:

🔧 Reviewing schematics and bringing up new boards

🛠️ Building and customizing Linux images

⚙️ Configuring device trees, U-Boot, and the Linux kernel

🧩 Developing firmware, drivers, and userspace applications

📡 Integrating with FPGAs and managing OTA update solutions
